# **Custom Discord Invite Link Checker**


This repository hosts a sophisticated web application tailored for users who need to verify the availability of custom Discord invite links based on specific keywords. The tool is particularly useful for communities and server administrators who want to create unique and memorable invite links that align with their branding or purpose. By simply entering a desired keyword, users can quickly determine whether the corresponding invite link is already in use by another server or if it is free to be created.

The application features a user-friendly and terminal-like interface, making it easy for users to input their keywords and receive instant feedback on the status of the invite link. This intuitive design ensures a smooth user experience, allowing even those with minimal technical expertise to navigate the tool with ease.

At the core of this project is a robust Python backend that interacts seamlessly with the Discord API. This backend ensures that each invite link check is conducted with precision, providing users with accurate and reliable results. Whether you're setting up a new server or rebranding an existing one, this tool simplifies the process of securing the perfect invite link, saving you time and ensuring consistency across your Discord presence.
